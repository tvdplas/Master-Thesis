  abstract = {The vehicle scheduling problem (VSP) is a traditional problem in public transport. One of the main assumptions is that buses can be operated the whole day without any interruption for refueling etc. Recently, new technological innovations have led to the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs). For these new vehicles, we cannot ignore the need of refueling during the day, as the range of an electric bus is severely limited, because of the capacity of the batteries. In this paper, we study the electric VSP (e-VSP), where we use EVs with a limited range. During the day the batteries can be charged; in this paper we assume that a battery cannot be replaced/substituted. We present two models that differ in the level of detail resembling the actual processes. In our first model, we assume a linear charging process, work with a constant price of electricity during the day, and do not take the effect of the depth-of-discharge on the lifetime of the battery into account. Our second model resembles practice much better: we allow any type of charging process, work with the actual electricity prices, and take the depreciation cost of the battery into account. To keep this model tractable, however, we approximate the exact value of the charge by discretizing it. The refined model can be solved to optimality using integer linear programming for instances of small/medium size, and therefore, we describe two other solution methods based on column generation that find good, but not necessarily optimal, solutions for large instances. We have tested our algorithms on real-world instances.},

  abstract = {The use of electric buses is expected to rise due to its environmental benefits. However, electric vehicles are less flexible than conventional diesel buses due to their limited driving range and longer recharging times. Therefore, scheduling electric vehicles adds further operational difficulties. Additionally, various labor regulations challenge public transport companies to find a cost-efficient crew schedule. Vehicle and crew scheduling problems essentially define the cost of operations. In practice, these two problems are often solved sequentially. In this paper, we introduce the integrated electric vehicle and crew scheduling problem (E-VCSP). Given a set of timetabled trips and recharging stations, the E-VCSP is concerned with finding vehicle and crew schedules that cover the timetabled trips and satisfy operational constraints, such as limited driving range of electric vehicles and labor regulations for the crew while minimizing total operational cost. An adaptive large neighborhood search that utilizes branch-and-price heuristics is proposed to tackle the E-VCSP. The proposed method is tested on real-life instances from public transport companies in Denmark and Sweden that contain up to 1109 timetabled trips. The heuristic approach provides evidence of improving efficiency of transport systems when the electric vehicle and crew scheduling aspects are considered simultaneously. By comparing to the traditional sequential approach, the heuristic finds improvements in the range of 1.17–4.37% on average. A sensitivity analysis of the electric bus technology is carried out to indicate its implications for the crew schedule and the total operational cost. The analysis shows that the operational cost decreases with increasing driving range (120–250 km) of electric vehicles.}

Nowadays, due to the new policies and regulations related to greenhouse gas emission in the transport sector, logistic companies are paying higher penalties for each emission gram of CO2/km. With electric vehicle market penetration, many companies are evaluating the integration of electric vehicles in their fleet, as they do not have local greenhouse gas emissions, produce minimal noise, and are independent of the fluctuating oil price. The well-researched vehicle routing problem (VRP) is extended to the electric vehicle routing problem (E-VRP), which takes into account specific characteristics of electric vehicles. In this paper, a literature review on recent developments regarding the E-VRP is presented. The challenges that emerged with the integration of electric vehicles in the delivery processes are described, together with electric vehicle characteristics and recent energy consumption models. Several variants of the E-VRP and related problems are observed. To cope with the new routing challenges in E-VRP, efficient VRP heuristics and metaheuristics had to be adapted. An overview of the state-of-the-art procedures for solving the E-VRP and related problems is presented.},

  abstract = {Encouraged by international efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and local emissions, many public transport operators are converting their fleets to battery-powered electric buses. Public transport operators can choose between different electric bus concepts, with the total cost of ownership being the most important decision criterion. The associated strategic decisions regarding charging strategy, vehicle concept, and charging infrastructure have a significant impact on the operational planning of the electric buses. Motivated by this, this paper aims to analyze the interactions between electrification and operational planning, especially vehicle scheduling and crew scheduling. This allows us to make a more comprehensive comparison of different electrification concepts. Prior work has addressed the impact of electrification on vehicle scheduling but has neglected the interactions with crew scheduling. Crew scheduling dominates operational costs and planning for many public transport operators and must therefore be considered in all strategic decisions. For this reason, in this work we focused on integrated electric vehicle and crew scheduling problem. This allows us to calculate the total cost of ownership of different electric bus concepts under better representation of local conditions. We deal with the electric vehicle and crew scheduling problem with a metaheuristic based on Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search. We tested the developed methodology for a real-world bus route. Our results indicate that the constraints for crew scheduling significantly impact the total cost of ownership and the required number of vehicles of the different electrification concepts. Our case study suggests that the choice of the most cost-effective concept depends significantly on crew scheduling constraints. These findings imply that crew scheduling constraints should be considered as part of the local framework for bus fleet electrification.}

  abstract       = {Replacing conventional buses with electric buses is in line with the concept of sustainable development. However, electric buses have the disadvantages of short driving range and high purchase price. Many cities must implement a semi-electrification strategy for bus routes. In this paper, a bi-level, multi-objective programming model is established for the collaborative scheduling problem of vehicles and drivers on a bus route served by the mixed bus fleet. The upper-layer model minimizes the operation cost and economic cost of carbon emission to optimize the vehicle and charging scheme; while the lower-layer model tries to optimize the crew-scheduling scheme with the objective of minimizing driver wages and maximizing the degree of bus-driver specificity, considering the impact of drivers’ labor restrictions. Then, the improved multi-objective particle swarm algorithm based on an ε-constraint processing mechanism is used to solve the problem. Finally, an actual bus route is taken as an example to verify the effectiveness of the model. The results show that the established model can reduce the impact of unbalanced vehicle scheduling in mixed fleets on crew scheduling, ensure the degree of driver–bus specificity to standardize operation, and save the operation cost and driver wage.},

However, electric buses have limited driving range and long recharging times. Additionally, electric buses require special charging infrastructure, which overall makes them less flexible than conventional diesel buses. Due to the limitations of the electric bus technologies, further adjustments have to be made to the current bus transport planning problems. The scheduling of electric vehicles is recognized as a fast-growing area of research. In this paper, we review 43 articles related to the electric bus technologies and give an overview of the different problems in the electric bus planning process (strategic, tactical and operational). The different problems are: 1) investment of electric bus fleet and charging infrastructure, 2) placement of charging infrastructure, 3) the electric vehicle scheduling problem (E-VSP) and 4) the charging scheduling problem. Given a set of timetabled trips and recharging stations, the E-VSP is concerned with finding a vehicle schedule that covers the trips and satisfies the driving range and recharging requirements of electric buses while minimizing operational cost. A detailed literature review of the constraints associated with the E-VSP and the solution approaches proposed to solve it is given. Rescheduling aspects or considerations of robustness for scheduling of electric vehicles is identified as a future area of research. Furthermore, integrated electric bus planning is considered as a crucial area of research and integrated approaches could further improve the efficiency of electric bus transport systems.}

Hence, it is important for transport companies to minimize the overall cost of driver schedules. A duty is defined as the work of a driver for a day and the driver scheduling problem (DSP) is concerned with finding an optimal set of driver duties to cover a set of timetabled bus trips. Numerous labor regulations and other practical conditions enforce drivers to travel within the city network to designated bus stops to start/end duty, to take a break or to takeover a bus from another driver. This paper focuses on the driver scheduling problem with staff cars (DSPSC), where staff cars can be utilized by the drivers to fulfill their travel activities. However, staff cars should always be returned to the depot and can perform multiple round trips during the day. The problem is restricted by the number of cars available at the depot. We present a matheuristic for solving the DSPSC and the proposed method is tested on instances from Danish and Swedish companies. A comparison with a state-of-the-art mixed integer programming (MIP) solver indicates that the matheuristic provides better solutions, with comparable computation times, for 6 out of 10 large instances. For instances that have more than 6 staff cars and 1200 bus trips, the improvement is 13–15% on average.}

Computational results on randomly generated instances show that the column generation heuristic performs the best when enough computational time is available and stability is required, while the large neighborhood search method is the best alternative when looking for good quality solutions in relatively fast computational times.},

The main part of the model consists of a set partitioning formulation to cover the desired trips of the schedule. Because of the great number of columns, e.g. more than 5 million for a problem with 30 trips, a column generation algorithm is implemented to use all columns implicitly for the calculation of the continuous relaxation of the set partitioning problem. The column generation algorithm is embedded in a brauch and bound approach to generate an exact solution for the problem. To generate even better lower bound, polyhedral cuts basing on clique detection and a variant of the column generation algorithm that suits the cuts were tested.},

LNS is analogous to the shuffing technique of job-shop scheduling, and so meshes well with constraint programming technology. LNS explores a large neighbourhood of the current solution by selecting a number of ``related'' customer visits to remove from the set of planned routes, and re-inserting these visits using a constraint-based tree search. Unlike similar methods, we use Limited Discrepancy Search during the tree search to re-insert visits. We analyse the performance of our method on benchmark problems. We demonstrate that results produced are competitive with Operations Research meta-heuristic methods, indicating that constraint-based technology is directly applicable to vehicle routing problems},

  abstract = {This paper presents new models for multiple depot vehicle scheduling problem (MDVS) and multiple depot vehicle scheduling problem with route time constraints (MDVSRTC). The route time constraints are added to the MDVS problem to account for the real world operational restrictions such as fuel consumption. Compared to existing formulations, this formulation decreases the size of the problem by about 40% without eliminating any feasible solution. It also presents an exact and two heuristic solution procedures for solving the MDVSRTC problem. Although these methods can be used to solve medium size problems in reasonable time, real world applications in large cities require that the MDVSRTC problem size be reduced. Two techniques are proposed to decrease the size of the real world problems. For real-world application, the problem of bus transit vehicle scheduling at the mass transit administration (MTA) in Baltimore is studied. The final results of model implementation are compared to the MTA's schedules in January 1998. The comparison indicates that, the proposed model improves upon the MTA schedules in all respects. The improvements are 7.9% in the number of vehicles, 4.66% in the operational time and 5.77% in the total cost.}

  abstract = { Consolidation carriers transport shipments that are small relative to trailer capacity. To be cost effective, the carrier must consolidate shipments, which requires coordinating their paths in both space and time; i.e., the carrier must solve a service network design problem. Most service network design models rely on discretization of time—i.e., instead of determining the exact time at which a dispatch should occur, the model determines a time interval during which a dispatch should occur. While the use of time discretization is widespread in service network design models, a fundamental question related to its use has never been answered: Is it possible to produce an optimal continuous-time solution without explicitly modeling each point in time? We answer this question in the affirmative. We develop an iterative refinement algorithm using partially time-expanded networks that solves continuous-time service network design problems. An extensive computational study demonstrates that the algorithm not only is of theoretical interest but also performs well in practice. }

  abstract = { The rise of battery-powered vehicles has led to many new technical and methodological hurdles. Among these, the efficient planning of an electric fleet to fulfill passenger transportation requests still represents a major challenge. This is because of the specific constraints of electric vehicles, bound by their battery autonomy and necessity of recharge planning, and the large scale of the operations, which challenges existing optimization algorithms. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a scalable column generation approach for routing and scheduling in this context. Our algorithm relies on four main ingredients: (i) a multigraph reformulation of the problem based on a characterization of nondominated charging arcs, (ii) an efficient bidirectional pricing algorithm using tight backward bounds, (iii) sparsification approaches permitting to decrease the size of the subjacent graphs dramatically, and (iv) a diving heuristic, which locates near-optimal solutions in a fraction of the time needed for a complete branch-and-price. Through extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous algorithms for this setting, leading to accurate solutions for problems counting several hundreds of requests.Funding: This work was supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico [Grants 08528/2018-2 and 315361/2020-4], Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior [Finance Code 001], and Fundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro [Grants E-26/010.002232/2019 and E-26/202.790/2019].Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2023.1199. }

The electric vehicles are allowed to be recharged fully or partially at any of the given recharging stations. The objective is to firstly minimize the number of vehicles needed to cover all the timetabled trips, and secondly to minimize the total traveling distance, which is equivalent to minimizing the total deadheading distance. A mixed integer programming formulation as well as an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) heuristic for the E-VSP are presented. ALNS is tested on newly generated E-VSP benchmark instances. Result shows that the proposed heuristic can provide good solutions to large E-VSP instances and optimal or near-optimal solutions to small E-VSP instances.}

  abstract = {This study aims to determine the battery electric bus service and charging strategy to minimize the total operational cost of transit system, where the cost incurred by battery degradation and non-linear charging profile is taken into account. We formulate a set partitioning model for this problem, subject to predefined trip schedule and limited charging facilities. A tailored branch-and-price approach is then proposed to find the global optimal solution. In particular, we develop an effective multi-label correcting method to deal with the pricing problem (i.e., generating columns) in column generation procedure within the branch-and-price framework, coupled with a dual stabilization technique with an aim to accelerate the convergence rate. Meanwhile, a branch-and-bound solution approach is adopted to guarantee optimal integer solutions. Numerical experiments and a case study arising from real transit network are conducted to further assess the efficiency and applicability of the proposed method. Our experiments confirm that, despite the complexity of the considered problem, optimal solution can still be generated within reasonable computational time using the proposed algorithm. The results also show considerable cost saving (about 10.1–27.3% less) if this optimization model is implemented, mainly contributed by the substantial extension of battery life. A number of managerial insights stemmed from the numerical case study are outlined, which can help transit operators formulate more cost-efficient electric bus fleet scheduling plans.}

Nonetheless, challenges such as limited driving range and battery degradation, to some extent, hinder the extensive deployment of BEBs. This paper provides a comprehensive review of BEB adoption and utilization over the past decade, categorizing the state-of-the-art development and our discussion on BEB charging facility planning (BEB-CFP) and BEB charging scheduling (BEB-CS). In this review paper, we first survey the prevailing charging technologies in the BEB market and evaluate their applicability and limitations. Subsequently, the paper synthesizes the development and application of these technologies in terms of related infrastructure planning and charging scheduling operation, focusing on their unique considerations, modeling approaches, solution algorithms, and practical applications. Last, the paper concludes by identifying avenues for future research. Our findings contribute to the literature by providing a holistic revisit of BEB-CFP and BEB-CS with different types of charging technologies, offering selection recommendations and insights for both practitioners and policymakers aiming to optimize the utilization and sustainability of BEB fleets.}

abstract = {The airline crew scheduling problem has become a crucial but challenging task for commercial airlines for decades. Airlines are operating with two types of air crew: cockpit crew and cabin crew. Due to the unique operating characteristics, the scheduling problems for these two crew types are very different. Besides, according to the planning stage, the airline crew scheduling problem can be classified as tactical planning problems (traditional scheduling and robust scheduling, weeks or months before the actual operations) and operational planning problems (recovery, after disruptions have occurred during the operational stage). Realizing the significance of the airline crew scheduling problems and a lack of review on the modelling and algorithmic advancements in terms of each crew type and planning stage, we develop this paper to review the related literature from four aspects: the scheduling for cabin crew, the scheduling for both cabin crew and cockpit crew, the robust scheduling for cockpit crew, and the recovery for cockpit crew. For each stream, we examine a number of prior representative studies to review the advancements in model development and solution algorithm construction to generate insights. Finally, we conclude the review by proposing a future research agenda for the airline crew scheduling problem.}

title = "Integrated gate and bus assignment at Amsterdam airport schiphol",
abstract = "At an airport a series of assignment problems need to be solved before aircraft can arrive and depart and passengers can embark and disembark. A lot of different parties are involved with this, each of which having to plan their own schedule. Two of the assignment problems that the 'Regie' at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) is responsible for, are the gate assignment problem (i.e. where to place which aircraft) and the bus assignment problem (i.e. which bus will transport which passengers to or from the aircraft). Currently these two problems are solved in a sequential fashion, the output of the gate assignment problem is used as input for the bus assignment problem. We look at integrating these two sequential problems into one larger problem that considers both problems at the same time. This creates the possibility of using information regarding the bus assignment problem while solving the gate assignment problem. We developed a column generation algorithm for this problem and have implemented a prototype. To make the algorithm efficient we used a special technique called stabilized column generation and also column deletion. Computational experiments with data based on real-life data from AAS indicate that our algorithm is able to compute a planning for one day at Schiphol in a reasonable time.",

abstract = {Column generation is often used to solve large-scale optimization problems, and much research has been devoted to improve the convergence of the solution process. We focus on Kelley's algorithm, which frequently exhibits slow convergence, and propose an algorithm that stabilizes and accelerates the solution process while remaining within the linear programming framework. Preliminary numerical results, obtained on air transportation and location problems, show that the stabilized algorithm can be used to improve the solution times for difficult instances and to solve larger ones.}
