abstract={The vehicle scheduling problem (VSP) is a traditional problem in public transport. One of the main assumptions is that buses can be operated the whole day without any interruption for refueling etc. Recently, new technological innovations have led to the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs). For these new vehicles, we cannot ignore the need of refueling during the day, as the range of an electric bus is severely limited, because of the capacity of the batteries. In this paper, we study the electric VSP (e-VSP), where we use EVs with a limited range. During the day the batteries can be charged; in this paper we assume that a battery cannot be replaced/substituted. We present two models that differ in the level of detail resembling the actual processes. In our first model, we assume a linear charging process, work with a constant price of electricity during the day, and do not take the effect of the depth-of-discharge on the lifetime of the battery into account. Our second model resembles practice much better: we allow any type of charging process, work with the actual electricity prices, and take the depreciation cost of the battery into account. To keep this model tractable, however, we approximate the exact value of the charge by discretizing it. The refined model can be solved to optimality using integer linear programming for instances of small/medium size, and therefore, we describe two other solution methods based on column generation that find good, but not necessarily optimal, solutions for large instances. We have tested our algorithms on real-world instances.},

abstract = {The use of electric buses is expected to rise due to its environmental benefits. However, electric vehicles are less flexible than conventional diesel buses due to their limited driving range and longer recharging times. Therefore, scheduling electric vehicles adds further operational difficulties. Additionally, various labor regulations challenge public transport companies to find a cost-efficient crew schedule. Vehicle and crew scheduling problems essentially define the cost of operations. In practice, these two problems are often solved sequentially. In this paper, we introduce the integrated electric vehicle and crew scheduling problem (E-VCSP). Given a set of timetabled trips and recharging stations, the E-VCSP is concerned with finding vehicle and crew schedules that cover the timetabled trips and satisfy operational constraints, such as limited driving range of electric vehicles and labor regulations for the crew while minimizing total operational cost. An adaptive large neighborhood search that utilizes branch-and-price heuristics is proposed to tackle the E-VCSP. The proposed method is tested on real-life instances from public transport companies in Denmark and Sweden that contain up to 1109 timetabled trips. The heuristic approach provides evidence of improving efficiency of transport systems when the electric vehicle and crew scheduling aspects are considered simultaneously. By comparing to the traditional sequential approach, the heuristic finds improvements in the range of 1.17–4.37% on average. A sensitivity analysis of the electric bus technology is carried out to indicate its implications for the crew schedule and the total operational cost. The analysis shows that the operational cost decreases with increasing driving range (120–250 km) of electric vehicles.}

abstract = {In order to ensure high-quality and on-time delivery in logistic distribution processes, it is necessary to efficiently manage the delivery fleet. Nowadays, due to the new policies and regulations related to greenhouse gas emission in the transport sector, logistic companies are paying higher penalties for each emission gram of CO2/km. With electric vehicle market penetration, many companies are evaluating the integration of electric vehicles in their fleet, as they do not have local greenhouse gas emissions, produce minimal noise, and are independent of the fluctuating oil price. The well-researched vehicle routing problem (VRP) is extended to the electric vehicle routing problem (E-VRP), which takes into account specific characteristics of electric vehicles. In this paper, a literature review on recent developments regarding the E-VRP is presented. The challenges that emerged with the integration of electric vehicles in the delivery processes are described, together with electric vehicle characteristics and recent energy consumption models. Several variants of the E-VRP and related problems are observed. To cope with the new routing challenges in E-VRP, efficient VRP heuristics and metaheuristics had to be adapted. An overview of the state-of-the-art procedures for solving the E-VRP and related problems is presented.},

abstract = {Encouraged by international efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and local emissions, many public transport operators are converting their fleets to battery-powered electric buses. Public transport operators can choose between different electric bus concepts, with the total cost of ownership being the most important decision criterion. The associated strategic decisions regarding charging strategy, vehicle concept, and charging infrastructure have a significant impact on the operational planning of the electric buses. Motivated by this, this paper aims to analyze the interactions between electrification and operational planning, especially vehicle scheduling and crew scheduling. This allows us to make a more comprehensive comparison of different electrification concepts. Prior work has addressed the impact of electrification on vehicle scheduling but has neglected the interactions with crew scheduling. Crew scheduling dominates operational costs and planning for many public transport operators and must therefore be considered in all strategic decisions. For this reason, in this work we focused on integrated electric vehicle and crew scheduling problem. This allows us to calculate the total cost of ownership of different electric bus concepts under better representation of local conditions. We deal with the electric vehicle and crew scheduling problem with a metaheuristic based on Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search. We tested the developed methodology for a real-world bus route. Our results indicate that the constraints for crew scheduling significantly impact the total cost of ownership and the required number of vehicles of the different electrification concepts. Our case study suggests that the choice of the most cost-effective concept depends significantly on crew scheduling constraints. These findings imply that crew scheduling constraints should be considered as part of the local framework for bus fleet electrification.}

ABSTRACT = {Replacing conventional buses with electric buses is in line with the concept of sustainable development. However, electric buses have the disadvantages of short driving range and high purchase price. Many cities must implement a semi-electrification strategy for bus routes. In this paper, a bi-level, multi-objective programming model is established for the collaborative scheduling problem of vehicles and drivers on a bus route served by the mixed bus fleet. The upper-layer model minimizes the operation cost and economic cost of carbon emission to optimize the vehicle and charging scheme; while the lower-layer model tries to optimize the crew-scheduling scheme with the objective of minimizing driver wages and maximizing the degree of bus-driver specificity, considering the impact of drivers’ labor restrictions. Then, the improved multi-objective particle swarm algorithm based on an ε-constraint processing mechanism is used to solve the problem. Finally, an actual bus route is taken as an example to verify the effectiveness of the model. The results show that the established model can reduce the impact of unbalanced vehicle scheduling in mixed fleets on crew scheduling, ensure the degree of driver–bus specificity to standardize operation, and save the operation cost and driver wage.},

Indeed, the interaction between these elements is quite complex, leading to intractable decision making problems. The planning process and real-time control strategies have been widely studied in recent years, and there are several practical implementations with promising results. In this paper, we review the literature on Transit Network Planning problems and real-time control strategies suitable to bus transport systems. Our goal is to present a comprehensive review, emphasizing recent studies as well as works not addressed in previous reviews.}

abstract = {Electrification of bus fleets in most cities is expected to rise due to its significant environmental benefits. However, electric buses have limited driving range and long recharging times. Additionally, electric buses require special charging infrastructure, which overall makes them less flexible than conventional diesel buses. Due to the limitations of the electric bus technologies, further adjustments have to be made to the current bus transport planning problems. The scheduling of electric vehicles is recognized as a fast-growing area of research. In this paper, we review 43 articles related to the electric bus technologies and give an overview of the different problems in the electric bus planning process (strategic, tactical and operational). The different problems are: 1) investment of electric bus fleet and charging infrastructure, 2) placement of charging infrastructure, 3) the electric vehicle scheduling problem (E-VSP) and 4) the charging scheduling problem. Given a set of timetabled trips and recharging stations, the E-VSP is concerned with finding a vehicle schedule that covers the trips and satisfies the driving range and recharging requirements of electric buses while minimizing operational cost. A detailed literature review of the constraints associated with the E-VSP and the solution approaches proposed to solve it is given. Rescheduling aspects or considerations of robustness for scheduling of electric vehicles is identified as a future area of research. Furthermore, integrated electric bus planning is considered as a crucial area of research and integrated approaches could further improve the efficiency of electric bus transport systems.}
