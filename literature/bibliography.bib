abstract={The vehicle scheduling problem (VSP) is a traditional problem in public transport. One of the main assumptions is that buses can be operated the whole day without any interruption for refueling etc. Recently, new technological innovations have led to the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs). For these new vehicles, we cannot ignore the need of refueling during the day, as the range of an electric bus is severely limited, because of the capacity of the batteries. In this paper, we study the electric VSP (e-VSP), where we use EVs with a limited range. During the day the batteries can be charged; in this paper we assume that a battery cannot be replaced/substituted. We present two models that differ in the level of detail resembling the actual processes. In our first model, we assume a linear charging process, work with a constant price of electricity during the day, and do not take the effect of the depth-of-discharge on the lifetime of the battery into account. Our second model resembles practice much better: we allow any type of charging process, work with the actual electricity prices, and take the depreciation cost of the battery into account. To keep this model tractable, however, we approximate the exact value of the charge by discretizing it. The refined model can be solved to optimality using integer linear programming for instances of small/medium size, and therefore, we describe two other solution methods based on column generation that find good, but not necessarily optimal, solutions for large instances. We have tested our algorithms on real-world instances.},

abstract = {The use of electric buses is expected to rise due to its environmental benefits. However, electric vehicles are less flexible than conventional diesel buses due to their limited driving range and longer recharging times. Therefore, scheduling electric vehicles adds further operational difficulties. Additionally, various labor regulations challenge public transport companies to find a cost-efficient crew schedule. Vehicle and crew scheduling problems essentially define the cost of operations. In practice, these two problems are often solved sequentially. In this paper, we introduce the integrated electric vehicle and crew scheduling problem (E-VCSP). Given a set of timetabled trips and recharging stations, the E-VCSP is concerned with finding vehicle and crew schedules that cover the timetabled trips and satisfy operational constraints, such as limited driving range of electric vehicles and labor regulations for the crew while minimizing total operational cost. An adaptive large neighborhood search that utilizes branch-and-price heuristics is proposed to tackle the E-VCSP. The proposed method is tested on real-life instances from public transport companies in Denmark and Sweden that contain up to 1109 timetabled trips. The heuristic approach provides evidence of improving efficiency of transport systems when the electric vehicle and crew scheduling aspects are considered simultaneously. By comparing to the traditional sequential approach, the heuristic finds improvements in the range of 1.17–4.37% on average. A sensitivity analysis of the electric bus technology is carried out to indicate its implications for the crew schedule and the total operational cost. The analysis shows that the operational cost decreases with increasing driving range (120–250 km) of electric vehicles.}
